This project demonstrates how to send Ethereum transactions programmatically using Node.js, Web3.js, and Infura as a blockchain provider. The sender's wallet is managed via MetaMask, and transactions are signed and sent securely using Web3.js.
 Tech Stack
Node.js – Backend server environment

Express.js – REST API for managing transaction routes

Web3.js – Ethereum JavaScript API for blockchain interactions

Infura.io – Ethereum node provider for sending transactions without running a full node

MetaMask – Ethereum wallet used to sign transactions (sender’s private key is securely stored)

*Features*

✅ Create and sign Ethereum transactions using a MetaMask wallet

✅ Send signed transactions via Infura

✅ REST API structure with routes and controllers

✅ Handles nonce, gas, and error management

✅ Fully modular and scalable backend code

🔐 *Security*
Private keys are never exposed or logged

MetaMask is used to manage private key and sign transactions

Infura ensures safe and fast network access
